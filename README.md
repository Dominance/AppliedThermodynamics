USE WITH CARE. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY KIND OF DAMAGE DONE.

AT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a mod that adds Heat to ME Networks, the bigger and more power hungry the network is, the faster it heats up,
the hotter the network gets, more and more bad effects happen, from particles and sounds to the Melting of your network into Liquid ME.

there are also ways to cool your system, right now non are fully implemented, but planned:

Wind Crank ( manually operated cooling machine)
Liquid Cooler (cools the network based on the liquid it is supplied)
Fan (it blows wind)
More and More.

As for suggestions and comments about my code and more ideas, visit #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net which is where i usually am when i work on AT.

My hope for release is 1.7 for AE2. no promises at all.
