<p>This is the Current Website (and github) for the Upcoming mod, Applied Thermodynamics.</p>

<p>Currently the mod is IN OPEN BETA!</p>

<p>Quick notice, Issue reports either go on the issue tracker here on github, Or Directly to me by
talking to me on #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net</p>

<p>Modpacks: Read the license. But in short, you need my written permission for any kind of modpacks
other than private ones (Where they are only distributed between a closed and small Community) that ofcourse it ok.</p>

<p>The one Exception for private modpacks is if you use AsieLauncher. Anyone using that on your server. You need to ask

<a name="explanation" class="anchor" href="#explanation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Explanation</h1>

<p>AT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a mod that adds Heat to ME Networks, the bigger and more power hungry the network is, the faster it heats up,
the hotter the network gets, more and more bad effects happen, from particles and sounds to the Melting of your network into Liquid ME.</p>

<p>there is LOTS more Coming, Not only Heat! Check out the <a href="https://github.com/tgame14/AppliedThermodynamics/wiki">wiki</a> for more information</p>

<p>More and More. (I am Taking Suggestions freely, as far as its a Solid suggestion and logical i may add it)</p>

<p>As for suggestions and comments about my code and more ideas, visit #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net which is where
i usually am when i work on AT.</p>

<p>My hope for release is 1.7 for AE2. no promises at all (non Dev Release - Right now its open beta, See downloads above).</p>

<p>I can not enforce anyone to follow this license. i do not have any sort of legal power Over you in that regard.

<h1>
<a name="notice" class="anchor" href="#notice"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notice</h1>

<p>I Seem to be Flamed a lot about this mod, so i want to clarify something.</p>

<p>AT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a Mod that Adds a new Balancing point to AE (Applied Energistics).
This new balancing point Is meant to Be challanging to the player. it is how I think Hardcore AE should be like.
If you dont like the idea and the implementation, I understand you completely. But Do not show disrespect of 
the way i feel and want this mod to be. Dont like it - Dont Play it. But Never just go off Judging it with no
real facts to back you up. Also dont judge the mod until i announce a version where it is out of Dev. the mod is
incomplete and Thus not even nearing a fully game Experience, if you dont understand that. Do not Expect me to
show much respect to you and whatever you are Flaming about. Otherwise if you Feel like some things could Be Added
Or changed for a better Experience i urge you to tell me, Another thing is that EVERYTHING is Configurable.
EVEN HEAT ITSELF! you can turn off heat and only enjoy the non heat related features i supply. That ofcourse
will mean you miss the point of the mod, But if you want that possibility, its there.
If i missed Something to be configurable. Let me know.</p>

<p>I try to Be as understanding and Explanatory as possible. Show me the respect of being the same way.</p>

<a name="compiling" class="anchor" href="#compiling"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compiling</h1>

<p>First of all, you dont need to compile it yourself, the jenkins link above is always synced to latest Github Commit!
Look for the big Downloads line above.</p>

<p>Yet if you are still interested in building manually..</p>

<p>1) Clone this github page to a directory.
2) open a cmd line at the folder and run 'gradlew.bat setupCIWorkspace'.
3) now open up build.gradle, and Remove line 13 (env = System.getenv()).
4) also, in build.gradle uncomment lines 68-83 (All of the increment task and the last lines).
5) replace line 32 with:
'version = config.mod_version + "." + config.build_number'.
6) now return to the cmd line and run 'gradlew.bat build'.
7) Done, Look inside the build/libs for it (The version in both the source and mcmod.info will be the same).</p>

<p>NOTE:
Every time you build the build number will increment, So keep that in mind.
Also a deobf version will also be built and put in build/libs Which ofcourse can be used for Dev environments.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Setting this up this way will not Allow you to edit the code, for that:</p>

<p>1) when you first clone the project, open a cmd line there and run 'gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace eclipse'.
2) Point your setup as Usual. and you should have it all done.
3) dont forget to Edit the build script if you want to still export the mod correctly.</p>

<p>DONE! this is Everything you need to know with compiling, Its done this way since the buildscript
in github is meant for a jenkins Server and not personal use. for personal use i do the edits i stated
above.</p>

<p>I DO NOT SUPPORT SELF COMPILED BUILDS OR UNOFFICIAL BUILDS. if you want my support, Use the builds i supply
either through jenkins or through the releases supplied Above.</p>
