{"name":"Applied Thermodynamics","tagline":"A Magnificant AE Addon","body":"Applied Thermodynamics\r\n==================\r\nThis is the Current Website (and github) for the Upcoming mod, Applied Thermodynamics.\r\n\r\nCurrently the mod is IN OPEN BETA!\r\n\r\nQuick notice, Issue reports either go on the issue tracker here on github, Or Directly to me by\r\ntalking to me on #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net\r\n\r\nModpacks: Read the license. But in short, you need my written permission for any kind of modpacks\r\nother than private ones (Where they are only distributed between a closed and small Community) that ofcourse it ok.\r\n\r\nThe one Exception for private modpacks is if you use AsieLauncher. Anyone using that on your server. You need to ask\r\nFor my permission. Doing otherwise will mean you are breaking the license.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownloads!\r\n==================\r\nhttps://github.com/tgame14/AppliedThermodynamics/releases\r\n\r\nFor the Latest Dev Builds (thanks themattabase!) :\r\n(click the button)\r\n[![Build Status](http://themattabase.com:9090/buildStatus/icon?job=Applied Thermodynamics)](http://themattabase.com:9090/job/Applied%20Thermodynamics/)\r\n\r\nUSE WITH CARE. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY KIND OF DAMAGE DONE.\r\n\r\nExplanation\r\n==================\r\nAT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a mod that adds Heat to ME Networks, the bigger and more power hungry the network is, the faster it heats up,\r\nthe hotter the network gets, more and more bad effects happen, from particles and sounds to the Melting of your network into Liquid ME.\r\n\r\nthere are also ways to cool your system, right now non are fully implemented, but planned:\r\n\r\nWind Crank ( manually operated cooling machine, not just done yet :)\r\n\r\nLiquid Cooler (cools the network based on the liquid it is supplied, Exists)\r\n\r\nFan (it blows wind, Exists as ME Simple Fan)\r\n\r\nAdvanced Fan Box (Already in the works):\r\nThe Advanced Fan Box will Accept a fluid called 'hot Air' And will process it as a new Fluid that\r\ncan be used in the liquid cooler.\r\n\r\nA bit of explanation On Calculations of Heat:\r\nHeat is calculated at a rate of 1% for every 2 ae/t of power usage, For Exaple:\r\n\r\na network of 20 ae/t Will generate 10% heat.\r\n\r\nHeat Also increases the power intake, Which in return increases Heat, it might seem like an infinite\r\nloop, But it only is if you Really overheat your network.\r\n\r\nThe Formula For the additional power heat takes up is:\r\npower usage / heat precentage\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nA network with 20 ae/t will generate 10% heat, And in return also generate an Additional\r\n2 ae/t, So in total you would have\r\n22ae/t, with 11% heat.\r\nNow dont forget, here the heat is calculated again.\r\nSo we go back to our 'clean' power usage,\r\n20 / 11 = which is 1.818...\r\n\r\nSo we end up with\r\n23.8 ae/t and 11.9% heat\r\n\r\nNow we can do the same calculation again. But we will end up with a change to power that will not\r\nReally affect the network.\r\n\r\nHere is when the heat calculations become not effective on power usage. It will still increase it.\r\nbut a very small amount you will not notice.\r\n\r\nExplanation of How coolants Work:\r\nThis gets a bit complex. So i will try and simplify it as much as i can.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of Machines. Active and Passive.\r\n\r\nActive machines will only cool the network if a certain fuel, Or a certain case needs to happen.\r\nfor example, The Liquid Cooler. it will only cool if it is given a fluid to cool with.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and More. (I am Taking Suggestions freely, as far as its a Solid suggestion and logical i may add it)\r\n\r\nAs for suggestions and comments about my code and more ideas, visit #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net which is where\r\ni usually am when i work on AT.\r\n\r\nMy hope for release is 1.7 for AE2. no promises at all (non Dev Release - Right now its open beta, See downloads above).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=========\r\nTHIS MOD IS OPEN-SOURCE, YOU MAY USE SMALL SAMPLES OF IT FOR LEARNING PURPOSES AND PRIVATE PROJECTS.\r\nIN ALL CASES THIS WEBPAGE MUST BE LINKED AS THE SOURCE AND CREDIT MUST BE GIVEN PROPERLY.\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS MOD BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE CREATOR IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.\r\nCOMPILING THIS MOD IS ALLOWED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.\r\n\r\nUSE THE MOD WITH SPECIAL CARE. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SORT OR KIND OF DAMAGE DONE TO YOU,\r\nYOUR PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER EXTENSION OF YOURSELF. THIS MOD IS SUPPLIED 'AS IS'. NO GUARRANTIES.\r\n\r\nIN THE CASE OF MODPACKS:\r\nADDING THIS MOD TO YOUR MODPACK IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE CREATOR.\r\nIN ORDER TO AQUIRE PERMISSION CONTACT WITH A REQUEST: tgameBusiness@gmail.com\r\nRECEIVING PERMISSION THROUGH ASKING TGAME14 DIRECTLY on irc.esper.net #AppliedEnergistics IS ALSO VIABLE.\r\n\r\nIN THE CASE OF AQUIRING PERMISSION, YOU MUST CREDIT WITH A LINK TO THIS WEBPAGE.\r\n\r\na few words about the license:\r\n\r\nI can not enforce anyone to follow this license. i do not have any sort of legal power Over you in that regard.\r\nif you do not follow the license, i will not come down to hunt you. i will though in the case of public modpacks,\r\nExpect for atleast that. the license is here because I expect the user of this mod to respect my mod and\r\nfollow my rules, which simply imply i have rights over my own work and i may do with it as i wish.\r\n\r\nNotice\r\n=========\r\nI Seem to be Flamed a lot about this mod, so i want to clarify something.\r\n\r\nAT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a Mod that Adds a new Balancing point to AE (Applied Energistics).\r\nThis new balancing point Is meant to Be challanging to the player. it is how I think Hardcore AE should be like.\r\nIf you dont like the idea and the implementation, I understand you completely. But Do not show disrespect of \r\nthe way i feel and want this mod to be. Dont like it - Dont Play it. But Never just go off Judging it with no\r\nreal facts to back you up. Also dont judge the mod until i announce a version where it is out of Dev. the mod is\r\nincomplete and Thus not even nearing a fully game Experience, if you dont understand that. Do not Expect me to\r\nshow much respect to you and whatever you are Flaming about. Otherwise if you Feel like some things could Be Added\r\nOr changed for a better Experience i urge you to tell me, Another thing is that EVERYTHING is Configurable.\r\nEVEN HEAT ITSELF! you can turn off heat and only enjoy the non heat related features i supply. That ofcourse\r\nwill mean you miss the point of the mod, But if you want that possibility, its there.\r\nIf i missed Something to be configurable. Let me know.\r\n\r\nI try to Be as understanding and Explanatory as possible. Show me the respect of being the same way.\r\n\r\nCompiling\r\n=========\r\nFirst of all, you dont need to compile it yourself, the jenkins link above is always synced to latest Github Commit!\r\nLook for the big Downloads line above.\r\n\r\nYet if you are still interested in building manually..\r\n\r\n1) Clone this github page to a directory.\r\n2) open a cmd line at the folder and run 'gradlew.bat setupCIWorkspace'.\r\n3) now open up build.gradle, and Remove line 13 (env = System.getenv()).\r\n4) also, in build.gradle uncomment lines 68-83 (All of the increment task and the last lines).\r\n5) replace line 32 with:\r\n'version = config.mod_version + \".\" + config.build_number'.\r\n6) now return to the cmd line and run 'gradlew.bat build'.\r\n7) Done, Look inside the build/libs for it (The version in both the source and mcmod.info will be the same).\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nEvery time you build the build number will increment, So keep that in mind.\r\nAlso a deobf version will also be built and put in build/libs Which ofcourse can be used for Dev environments.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, Setting this up this way will not Allow you to edit the code, for that:\r\n\r\n1) when you first clone the project, open a cmd line there and run 'gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace eclipse'.\r\n2) Point your setup as Usual. and you should have it all done.\r\n3) dont forget to Edit the build script if you want to still export the mod correctly.\r\n\r\nDONE! this is Everything you need to know with compiling, Its done this way since the buildscript\r\nin github is meant for a jenkins Server and not personal use. for personal use i do the edits i stated\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nI DO NOT SUPPORT SELF COMPILED BUILDS OR UNOFFICIAL BUILDS. if you want my support, Use the builds i supply\r\neither through jenkins or through the releases supplied Above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n=========\r\nThis mod would have been far harder without the help of a few Notable resources,\r\n\r\nThe Channel #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net For Great Ideas and help with technical issues Especially :\r\nraydeejay\r\nAlgorithmX2\r\nthatsIch\r\nM3gaFr3ak\r\nBlarghedy\r\n\r\ntheMattaBase For Setting up a jenkins for me, Thanks a lot!.\r\n\r\nAbrarSyed for Helping me a whole Lot with configuring forge gradle.\r\n\r\nPahimar for making his build script open source for me to learn parts :)\r\n\r\nVswe For his tutorials about Modding, The best ones i have seen so far.\r\n\r\nAnd Mostly, Thanks to you, the player, i hope you enjoy this as much as i did Making it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
